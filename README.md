LifeHash is a method of hash visualization based on Conway‚Äôs Game of Life that creates beautiful icons that are deterministic, yet distinct and unique given the input data.

The basic concept is to take a SHA256 hash of the input data (which can be any data including another hash) and then use the 256-bit digest as a 16x16 pixel "seed" for running the cellular automata known as [Conway‚Äôs Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).

After the pattern becomes stable (or begins repeating) the resulting history is used to compile a grayscale image of all the states from the first to last generation. Using Game of Life provides visual structure to the resulting image, even though it was seeded with entropy.

Some bits of the initial hash are then used to deterministically apply symmetry and color to the icon to add beauty and quick recognizability.

#### LifeHashTool Command Line Tool

[LifeHashTool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHashTool) is a command line tool written in Swift that generates LifeHash images as PNG files.

### üÜï New in Version 6!

Hot on the heels of version 5 comes version 6! The `.original` version has been renamed `.version1` and `.version2` has been introduced. `.version2` fixes a gradient scaling bug. Furthermore, `.version2` and `.fiducial` LifeHashes now also a CMYK-friendly palette that presents better in print, and in many cases looks less-garish on-screen. The LifeHash generation API still defaults to `.version1`, so you need do nothing if you're alreadying using it: you must opt-in to the other versions. Nonetheless, LifeHash `.version1` is now **DEPRECATED**, so if you're starting a new project, I recommend you pick one of the other styles.

#### LifeHashes In Five Flavors

* **`version1`** The Original. **DEPRECATED**
* **`version2`** Bug fixes and CMYK-friendly.
* **`detailed`** Now with twice the resolution, and CMYK-friendly.
* **`fiducial`** [Fiducials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiducial_marker#Fiducial_marker_sets) are symbols specifically optimized for recognition by machine vision algorithms like those in Apple's [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/). Now CMYK-friendly.
* **`grayscaleFiducial`** Highest contrast for low-light situations.

‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** The images generated by LifeHash from a given seed will not be recognizably similar between each of these versions. So pick the one you want to use for your application and stick with it!

### From the "LifeHash Example" demo app:

"LifeHash Example" lets you scroll through an endless table of LifeHashes generated from sequential integers, and tap on any of them to get a closer look. The selector at the top lets you choose to browse `.version2`, `.detailed`, `.fiducial`, and `.grayscaleFiducial` LifeHashes.

### From the "LifeHash Gallery" demo app:

"LifeHash Gallery" shows an elegant, artistic presentation of various collections of LifeHashes that automatically change every ten seconds. The latest version shows `.version2`, `.detailed`, and `.fiducial` LifeHashes.

### From the Mathematica implementation:

‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** The Mathematica implementation currently only generates `version1` LifeHashes.

## Tips for Presenting LifeHash Images

* Don't vignette or round the corners of a LifeHash image, every pixel contributes to the security of the image, so show the image as a square. If you *really* want to round the corners, make the radius small enough to still show the corner pixels.
* Don't interpolate or blur a LifeHash image: show every pixel crisply. On iOS UIKit this is accomplished by setting `layer.magnificationFilter = .nearest` on a `UIImageView`. Under SwiftUI you call `myImage.interpolation(.none)`. The iOS LifeHash library already does this for you.
* The iOS/Mac LifeHash library renders LifeHash images asynchronously and caches the result, so if you pass in the same Fingerprint you'll get the same image back right away. But if LifeHash rendering seems slow, be sure you're compiling the Release configuration of your target: LifeHash is *really fast* when compiled for Release.

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Wallet Standard Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about wallet standards, please use the Discussions area of the [Airgapped Signing repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning). This is where you can talk about projects like our [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) and command line tools such as [seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli), both of which are intended to testbed wallet technologies, plus the libraries that we've built to support your own deployment of wallet technology such as [bc-bip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39), [bc-slip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Shamir Secret Key Recovery](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur), and the [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base). If it's a wallet-focused technology or a more general discussion of wallet standards,discuss it here.
